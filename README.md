# Data Science Projects

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning, and hobby purposes. Mainly use R for different type of projects. 

*Note : data used for projects can be found in the data folder*

## Content 
### Machine Learning/Predictive Model
 * Supervised Learning
    * [Iris Classification](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/Iris_prediction/iris.md): Classification problem to identify the type of flower species. Four different features is used to accurately predict which type of species it is. 
    * [Big Mart Prediction](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/Bigmart/bigmart.md): Big Mart wants to predict each store's sales to help them manage their budgeting. Prediction model was created using machine learning techniques to understand relationship between different variables. 
    * [Home Loan](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/Home_loan/Loan.md): Drea Housing Finance deals with all home loans and now they would like to automate the process by filling in an online application. Predictive model is created for them to use in their system based on certain variables. 

 * Unsupervised Learning
     * [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/CustomerClustering/CustomerClustering.md): ZAA, a clothing company wanted to be able to group their customers so that they are able to communicate better with them. K-means clustering was used to group the customers based on past buying behaviours. 
     
## Exploratory Data Analysis
   * [Lung Capacity](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/Lungcap/lungcap.md): Lung capacity of each person is based on several factors. In this analysis, we will explore those relationship and understand how each of them can impact a person's lung capacity. 
   
## Dashboard
   * [Bigmart Sales](https://asyrafflatiffi.shinyapps.io/bigmartdashboard/): Bigmart's decision maker wants to see their sales data on a single file. They want to see if different attributes at the store impacts the store sales. Filters and also pivot tables are also included for decision makers to better understand their data. Used flexdashboard and pushed it on shinyio to put it online. 
 
## Linear Programming/Optimization Model
   * [Maximizing Boat Profit](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/BoatMax/boat.md): Floataway Tours want to invest in new boats to expand their business but are unsure how many type of boats they should but with their current budget. Linear programmingn was used to identify how many type of boats they should invest in to ensure maximum profit is achieved. 

## Monte Carlo Simulation
   * [Analyzing Risk of New Product](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/Goodfood/newproduct.md): Goodfood wants to launch a new product in their menu but wasn't sure of the risk. Monte Carlo simulation was used to help the company to identify the probability of incurring a lost as well as the probability of getting a certain amount of net profit.
