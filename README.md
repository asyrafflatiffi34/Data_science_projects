*Note : data used for projects can be found in the data folder*

## Content 
  * Machine Learning
    * [Iris Classification](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/Iris_prediction/iris.md): Classification problem to identify the type of flower species. Four different features is used to accurately predict which type of species it is. 
    * [Big Mart Prediction](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/big_mart_precition/blob/master/r_code): Create a prediction model to predict sales for shop. This would help them to minimize wastage and also fulfill all the demands.
    * [Loan Repayment](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/loan_prediction.R): Create a model to identify whether a loan application is able to repay a loan. 
    
  * Exploratory Data Analysis
    * [Lung Capacity](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/Lungcap/lungcap.md): Understading the relationship between lung capacity and five other variables(age,gender,smoke etc.)
