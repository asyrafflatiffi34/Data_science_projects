# Data Science Projects

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning, and hobby purposes. Mainly use R or Python for different projects. 

*Note : data used for projects can be found in the data folder*

### Machine Learning
 * Supervised Learning
    * [Iris Classification](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/Iris_prediction/iris.md): Classification problem to identify the type of flower species. Four different features is used to accurately predict which type of species it is. 
    * [Big Mart Prediction](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/Bigmart/bigmart.md): Create a prediction model to predict sales for shop. This would help them to minimize wastage and also fulfill all the demands.
    * [Home Loan](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/Home_loan/Loan.md): Create a predictive model for a company to idenfity a customer's loan eligibility so that they are able to process it at real time. 

 * Unsupervised Learning
     * [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/CustomerClustering/CustomerClustering.md): ZAA, a clothing company wanted to be able to group their customers so that they are able to communicate better with them. K-means clustering was used to group the customers based on past buying behaviours.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
   * [Lung Capacity](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/Lungcap/lungcap.md): Lung capacity of each person is based on several factors. In this analysis, we will explore those relationship and understand how each of them can impact a person's lung capacity. 
 
## Linear Programming 
   * [Maximizing Boat Profit](https://github.com/asyrafflatiffi34/data_science_projects/blob/master/BoatMax/boat.md): Maximizing boat profit with complex constraints by using linear programming.
